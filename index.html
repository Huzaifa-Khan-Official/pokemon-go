                    <p id="first_letter">Travel between the real world and the virtual world of Pokémon with Pokémon GO
                        for iPhone and
                        Android devices. With Pokémon GO, you'll discover Pokémon in a whole new world—your own! Pokémon
                        GO gives you the chance to explore real locations and search far and wide for Pokémon. More and
                        more Pokémon continue to appear around the globe, including rare and powerful Legendary Pokémon.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./assets/contentstartimg.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        As you move around the places where you live and visit, your smartphone can vibrate to let you
                        know when you're near a Pokémon. Once you've encountered a Pokémon, take aim on your
                        smartphone's touch screen and throw a Poké Ball to catch it—but be careful, or it might run
                        away! Also look for PokéStops located at interesting places—such as public art installations,
                        historical markers, and monuments—where you can collect more Poké Balls and other items.
                    </p>

                <br>
                <div class="contentcontainer">
                    <h1>Battle Other Trainers</h1>
                    <img src="./assets/contentcontainerimg1.png" alt="" id="img_2">
                    <p>
                        Are you ready for an exciting challenge? You can now take on another Trainer at any time in
                        Pokémon GO. With Trainer Battles, you can match up against another Trainer by using a Battle
                        Code, then face off using a team of three Pokémon. When the battle is over, both participants
                        receive great rewards, including a chance at rare Evolution items.

                        The fast-paced battles take place in real time, and your Pokémon can use both their Fast Attacks
                        and Charged Attacks. Just keep an eye on your opponent's attacks, and deploy a Protect Shield to
                        save your Pokémon from taking critical damage. Be careful, though—you only have a limited number
                        of Protect Shields before your Pokémon will be left defenseless against big attacks.

                        Your opponent will usually have to be nearby for you to initiate a Trainer Battle. But you can
                        challenge Trainers you're Ultra Friends or Best Friends with from any distance. Good luck,
                        Trainers!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="contentcontainer">
                    <h1>Make Friends, Exchange Gifts, and Trade Pokémon</h1>
                    <p>Get connected with your real-life friends in Pokémon GO, and you can interact with them in a
                        variety of exciting ways. After exchanging Trainer Codes, you will see your friends on your
                        Friend List.

                        One way that you'll be able to play with your friends in Pokémon GO is by giving Gifts. When you
                        spin a Photo Disc at a PokéStop or Gym, you have a chance of collecting a special Gift. Although
                        you can't open these Gifts yourself, you can send them to someone on your Friend List. The Gifts
                        contain a variety of helpful items (and occasionally special Eggs) and come with a postcard
                        showing where the Gift was collected.

                        You can increase your Friendship level with others by sending Gifts or participating in a Raid
                        or Gym Battle with them. As your Friendship level rises, bonuses can be unlocked.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./assets/contentcontainerimg2.png" alt="">
                    <p>There's another way to build your Friendship level, and that's by trading Pokémon! If you are
                        near a friend and have a Trainer level of 10 or higher, you can trade Pokémon with them.
                        Completing a trade requires Stardust, but it earns a bonus Candy for the Pokémon you traded
                        away, and that bonus increases if the Pokémon the two of you trade were caught in locations far
                        apart from each other.

                        Each Pokémon in the trade might become a Lucky Pokémon—you'll know right away by a new sparkly
                        appearance. These Lucky Pokémon require less Stardust to power up, too. And Lucky Pokémon can be
                        detected by the Pokédex so you can keep track of them. The longer the Pokémon have spent in
                        storage, the higher the chance that they will become Lucky Pokémon when they're traded.

                    <h1>Customize Your Trainer</h1>
                    <img src="./assets/contentcontainerimg3.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        When you first play Pokémon GO, you'll get to customize your Trainer, choosing apparel and
                        accessories to give them a cool look. Your customized Trainer will appear as you move around on
                        the map and on your profile page. Other players will also see your Trainer when they visit a Gym
                        you control or when you interact as friends (see below).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="contentcontainer">
                    <h1>Add to Your Pokédex</h1>
                    <p>In Pokémon GO, you will gain levels as a Trainer. At higher levels, you'll be able to catch more
                        powerful Pokémon to complete your Pokédex. You'll also have access to stronger items to heal
                        your Pokémon after battle, improved Poké Balls to give you a better shot at catching Pokémon,
                        and useful Berries. Keep exploring and catching Pokémon to raise your level.

                        There are other ways to add Pokémon to your Pokédex. If you catch the same species of Pokémon
                        enough times, you may be able to evolve it! And you may find Pokémon Eggs at PokéStops, which
                        will hatch once you've walked a certain distance with it in an incubator—perhaps resulting in a
                        Pokémon you've never seen before!

                        As you're out exploring, keep an eye on the real-world weather, as it will influence which
                        Pokémon you're likely to discover. For example, Water-type Pokémon will be more plentiful during
                        rainy weather.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="contentcontainer">
                    <h1>Join a Team and Battle</h1>
                    <p>At a certain point in the game, you'll be asked to join one of three teams. Once you join a team,
                        you'll gain the ability to assign your Pokémon to open Gym locations or to a Gym where a
                        teammate has already assigned a Pokémon. Each player can place only one Pokémon per Gym, so
                        you'll need to work together with other members of your team to build up a strong defense. Like
                        PokéStops, Gyms can be found at real-world locations.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./assets/contentcontainerimg4.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        If a rival team has claimed a Gym, you can challenge it by using your Pokémon to battle the
                        Pokémon defending the Gym. You choose which of your Pokémon will join in the battle. Each
                        Pokémon has two kinds of attacks, and can also dodge the defending Pokémon's attacks if you
                        swipe left or right. If your Pokémon win the battle, the motivation of the defending Pokémon is
                        reduced. When the motivation of each defending Pokémon drops to zero, the defending team loses
                        control of the Gym, and you or another player can then take control of it by assigning a Pokémon
                        to defend it.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Raid Battles</h1>
                    <p>Take on tough solitary Pokémon in exciting Raid Battles at select Gyms. These Raid Bosses are
                        more difficult to battle than the Pokémon you'd ordinarily catch in the wild—so tough that
                        you'll need to join up with other Trainers to take one of them on. If you can defeat the Raid
                        Boss, you'll earn a chance to add the powerful Pokémon to your team and get extremely rare
                        items.</p>

                        Professor Willow, your guide through the world of Pokémon GO, needs collaborators to help with
                        his research as he investigates mysterious events all over the world. There are two types of
                        research that Trainers can help with: Field Research and Special Research. Field Research tasks
                        can be found by spinning the Photo Disc at PokéStops and Gyms. You will receive objectives to
                        complete, such as discovering and catching certain Pokémon or engaging in battles. Professor
                        Willow will present the Special Research himself with story-driven activities that will take you
                        further into the world of Pokémon GO than ever before!

                        There's no limit to the number of research tasks that can be completed each day, and they grant
                        rewards such as useful items. The more difficult the task, the greater the reward, so
                        hard-working Trainers will benefit quite a bit.

                    <p>A portable device called the Poké Ball Plus enables you to enjoy the game even when you're not
                        looking at your smartphone. The device connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth and notifies
                        you about events in the game (such as the appearance of a Pokémon nearby) using an LED and
                        vibration. In addition, you can catch Pokémon or perform other simple actions by pressing the
                        button on the device.

                        There is also a deep connection between Pokémon GO and Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon:
                        Let's Go, Eevee! Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto region that you've caught in Pokémon
                        GO can be brought into these two new Nintendo Switch games.

                        Connecting Pokémon GO to Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! is also a
                        great way to meet the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal. Sending
                        Pokémon from Pokémon GO into one of the Nintendo Switch titles gets you certain items in the
                        app, such as Candies for the species of Pokémon you sent. However, the first time you send a
                        Pokémon, you'll also be able to get a very special item: a Mystery Box!
                    </p>

                        Opening a Mystery Box in Pokémon GO causes Meltan to appear for a limited time. Touch a Meltan
                        you see on the field map, and then try to catch it with a Poké Ball. By collecting 400 Meltan
                        Candies, you can evolve this Steel-type Pokémon into the powerful Melmetal.

                        You receive notifications when your Buddy Pokémon finds Candy for you and when an Egg is about
                        to hatch. Then, at the end of each week, Adventure Sync provides a summary of your activities,
                        including how much Candy you collected and how far you walked. You even earn rewards for every
                        distance milestone you cross.

                        You can opt in to Adventure Sync at any time, and the feature connects to both the Health app on
                        Apple devices and Google Fit on Android devices.

                    <h1>iPhone AR+ Mode</h1>
                    <p>Dive deeper into the fun of Pokémon encounters with AR+ mode, a feature available on iPhone 6s
                        and newer models running iOS 11 or higher. AR+ mode takes Pokémon GO's augmented reality feature
                        even further by placing the Pokémon you encounter firmly into the scene in front of you. With
                        AR+, you can get closer to a Pokémon to make it easier to catch, or line up the perfect picture.
                        But be careful as you approach the Pokémon, or you might scare it off!</p>

                    <p>Pokémon GO is available for download at no charge on the App Store and Google Play. Pokémon GO is
                        free to play, with loads of fun things to do and Pokémon to discover at every turn. For players
                        who want to enhance their Pokémon GO experience even more, certain items and features can be
                        accessed via in-app purchases. Players can spend real money on PokéCoins, the in-game currency
                        of Pokémon GO. PokéCoins can then be exchanged for power-ups, extra items, and more.</p>

                        When you encounter a Pokémon in the wild, you can turn on the camera feature, putting the wild
                        Pokémon into the live scene where your camera is facing. Line up your shot and hit the shutter
                        button to take the photo. You can then save the snapshot to your smartphone for you to share
                        however you'd like.
